## Introduction
Hello there! You might be wondering why I separated some of my projects from my [main GitHub profile](https://github.com/pilot2254). It's because I didn't want to create a mess there with repositories like: forks, personal projects, public projects, learning materials, etc. So I created this organization for the sole purpose of learning something new. However, keep in mind that although this organization contains game cheats, it is not only for them.

## Notice
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It includes a range of repositories, from beginner-level code to game cheat prototypes. Please note that:
>
> All game cheat repositories are strictly for educational use. While some target multiplayer games (e.g., CS2, Lethal Company, AssaultCube, No Man's Sky, and more), they were tested only in controlled environments (custom lobbies, singleplayer mode, bots, and consenting peers with anti-cheat disabled).
>
> Every such repository contains a clear disclaimer: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. These projects were created solely for learning. Do not report me or this github organization or its repositories, I do not support, promote cheating or abuse in multiplayer environments.
>
> I do not condone misuse. I accept no responsibility for bans, kicks, or consequences arising from unauthorized use.

## My personal quote
> A game cheater mindlessly consumes pre-made cheats to gain advantage. A game hacker builds cheats, dissecting systems and exploiting weaknesses. Cheaters learn nothing. Hackers learn everything.

  <summary>Are these cheats intended for real online play?</summary>
  <br />
  No. Every single repository here is for educational use only.<br />
  I do not support, condone, or promote cheating in multiplayer environments.<br />
  All testing is done in controlled setups - private lobbies, bots, or with consenting peers.<br />
  If you misuse the code, thatâ€™s entirely on you.

  <summary>Why did you separate learning materials from your main profile?</summary>
  <br />
  Like I said before, It's because I didn't want to create a mess there with repositories like: forks, personal projects, public projects, learning materials, etc.

  <summary>How did you get started making game cheats?</summary>
  <br />
  Since I was studying app development at home and game development at school, I wondered how I could combine these two subjects to learn something new. I searched for tutorials online and started learning Cheat Engine. After I learned the basics, I started combining it with dnSpy, and I'm currently on my way to combining it with C++.

  <summary>What was the first game for which you made a cheat?</summary>
  <br />
  Obviously, it was the Cheat Engine tutorial ðŸ˜….<br />
  But, to be honest, I don't really remember what the first game I made cheats for was. I think it was GTFO

  <summary>Why focus on cheats if you donâ€™t support cheating?</summary>
  <br />
  
  For me, itâ€™s fun. While learning how to make cheats, I picked up a massive amount of knowledge in programming, reverse engineering, and general computer science. Itâ€™s not about gaining unfair advantage, itâ€™s about learning how systems really work.

  <summary>How do you ensure your projects remain educational only?</summary>
  <br />
  
  By intent and by practice. I donâ€™t publish ready-to-use scripts for online abuse. Everything I push here is built with the mindset of learning and experimenting, not exploitation.

  <summary>Why do you include multiplayer games if you donâ€™t condone online cheating?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Because different games pose different challenges. Multiplayer titles often have protections and systems worth studying. Every multiplayer cheat Iâ€™ve built was tested only in controlled environmentsâ€”bots, private lobbies, or with consenting friends. Never in live matchmaking.

  <summary>Do you plan to transition this knowledge into anti-cheat development?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Iâ€™ve thought about it. Right now, I donâ€™t have the skills or resources to make a serious anti-cheat project. Maybe later. Itâ€™s a goal for the future.

  <summary>Whatâ€™s the hardest challenge you faced while making cheats?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Anticheat systems. Even the basic ones can wreck a beginner. Iâ€™m still at the beginner stage myself, and anticheat has always been the biggest wall.

  <summary>Whatâ€™s the educational value in building cheats?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Immense. Done properly, game hacking teaches memory management, assembly, reverse engineering, system internals, and practical problem-solving. Itâ€™s one of the most hands-on ways to dig into computer science.

  <summary>What would you recommend for someone who wants to start with reverse engineering?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Begin with the basics. Complete the entire Cheat Engine tutorial that ships with CE. After that, take a very simple game like <a href="https://longbowgames.com/dxball2/">DXBall2</a> and build a basic cheat table. Crawl before you run.

  <summary>Are you a lazy person?</summary>
  <br />
  
  Absolutely. Iâ€™m a certified procrastinator. Probably the laziest person alive. Somehow still managing to build this stuff anyway.
