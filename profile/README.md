## Introduction
Hello there! You might be wondering why I separated some of my projects from my [main GitHub profile](https://github.com/pilot2254). It's because I didn't want to create a mess there with repositories like: forks, personal projects, public projects, learning materials, etc. So I created this organization for the sole purpose of learning something new.

## Notice
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It includes a range of repositories, from beginner-level code to game cheat prototypes. Please note that:
>
> All game cheat repositories are strictly for educational use. While some target multiplayer games (e.g., CS2, Lethal Company, AssaultCube, No Man's Sky, and more), they were tested only in controlled environments (custom lobbies, singleplayer mode, bots, and consenting peers with anti-cheat disabled).
>
> Every such repository contains a clear disclaimer: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. These projects were created solely for learning. Do not report me or this github organization or its repositories, I do not support, promote cheating or abuse in multiplayer environments.
>
> I do not condone misuse. I accept no responsibility for bans, kicks, or consequences arising from unauthorized use.
>
> However, keep in mind that this organization is not only for game cheats.

## My personal quote
> A game cheater mindlessly consumes pre-made cheats to gain advantage. A game hacker builds cheats, dissecting systems and exploiting weaknesses. Cheaters learn nothing. Hackers learn everything.

  <summary>How did you get started making game cheats?</summary>
  <br />
  Since I was studying app development at home and game development at school, I wondered how I could combine these two subjects to learn something new. I searched for tutorials online and started learning Cheat Engine. After I learned the basics, I started combining it with dnSpy, and I'm currently on my way to combining it with C++.

  <summary>What was the first game for which you made a cheat?</summary>

  Obviously, it was the Cheat Engine tutorial ðŸ˜….<br />
  But, to be honest, I don't really remember what the first game I made cheats for was. I think it was GTFO
