> [!IMPORTANT]
> This organization exists to separate educational resources and experimental projects from my [main GitHub profile](https://github.com/pilot2254).
>
> It includes a range of repositories, from beginner-level code to game cheat prototypes.
>
> All game cheat repositories are strictly for educational use. While some target multiplayer games (e.g., CS2, Lethal Company, AssaultCube, No Man's Sky, and more), they were tested only in controlled environments (custom lobbies, singleplayer mode, bots, and consenting peers with anti-cheat disabled).
>
> Every such repository contains a clear disclaimer: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. These projects were created solely for learning. Do not report me or this github organization or its repositories, I do not support, promote cheating or abuse in multiplayer environments.
>
> I do not condone misuse. I accept no responsibility for bans, kicks, or consequences arising from unauthorized use.

> A game cheater mindlessly consumes pre-made cheats to gain advantage. A game hacker builds cheats, dissecting systems and exploiting weaknesses. Cheaters learn nothing. Hackers learn everything.
